# House-price-machine-learning
Regression algorithm is used to predict the price of Tehran's Houses.
Linear Regression is an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events.
It is a statistical method used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis.Now we want to use the scikit-learn (a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language) to fit our data then predict it via machine.
Data is about the price of the houses in Tehran.First of all you need to read and pre-preprocessing then use for your prediction. 
I uploaded data and my jupyter notebook file to train and test.
Good luck.
